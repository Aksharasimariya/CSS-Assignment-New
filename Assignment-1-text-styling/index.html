    <h1>CSS-Text-Style</h1>
    <p>This text is styled with some of the text formatting properties. The heading uses the text-align, text-transform, and color properties.
        CSS defines five generic names for fonts: serif , sans-serif , monospace , cursive , and fantasy . These are very generic and the exact font face used from these generic names can vary between each browser and each operating system that they are displayed on. </p>
